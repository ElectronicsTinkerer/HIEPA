# TODO

## Functional Stuff (Features)

* Add support for byte selection operators on 16 bit values
* Add multi-line macro support
* Add macro-function-like insert syntax ( ex: #define MAC(A) (A*2) )
* Verify addressing mode parser (parseargs()) is still working after rewrite of instruction table
* Add CLI args for passing ROM size, input file
* Add * as current PC syntax
* Add CLI arg to suppress PASS 1 "unknown symbol" messages
* Add CLI arg to add base ROM offset as first 2 bytes of bin output (.o64 format)
* Add CLI arg(s) that allow for auto-uploading of output bin to a remote device via a serial port

## Code Improvements

* If a symbol is unresolved when put into a .word directive, assembler prints warning that it is > 0xffff (when it should not)
* If a line is 'jsr', the assembler throws and exception and tries to assemble it as a br8 addr mode
